# Simple-2D-atmospheric-model
This code was written as part of a numerical modeling course. Thanks to Dr. Matthew Parker at NC State University for his instruction and laying out how to build the model.
It is a simple 2D atmospheric model which contains terrain in the form of 'step mountains'. The code is modularized with a driver code to control usage of the modules. The usersettings module is where most of the customization takes place (along with declarations module, in some cases).
