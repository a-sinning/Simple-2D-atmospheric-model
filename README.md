# Simple-2D-atmospheric-model
This code was written as part of a numerical modeling course. Thanks to Dr. Matthew Parker at NC State University for his instruction and laying out how to build the model.
It is a simple 2D atmospheric model which contains terrain in the form of 'step mountains'. The code is modularized with a driver code to control usage of the modules and subroutines. The usersettings module is where most of the customization takes place (along with the declarations module, in some cases). More information is contained in the additional comments for each file. The onefile.f90 is the concatenated model code, and the compile.sh code is what was used to compile as well as create the onefile.f90.
